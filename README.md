dlabMap
=======

Map for the DLab at UC Berkeley because the current map on their website isn't up to snuff according to me.

So I started designing a little map using OSM data and styling it in Tilemill.  Currently I'm trying to decide stuff I 
want to highlight and maybe tracing a few routes from nearby things (from BART station, or nearest parking structures).  

I'd be happy to crowd source stuff to add to the map so if you have any ideas check out the little geojson.io layer I'm
whipping up, and add to this one or make your own and share it with me!

I'd like to have a map made using bootleaf.io by Bryan McBride as a template before the end of the semester, maybe detail the
process of how I done did it if anyone seems interested or can't figure it out.
